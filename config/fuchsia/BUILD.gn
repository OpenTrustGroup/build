# of a macro or not. This is because a "reasonable" looking macro invocation
# may end up doing something silly internally. This can mean self assignment
# and tautological comparisons, since macros are not typed. Macros also tend
# to over-parenthesize, and so on. This particular list of options was found
# via trial and error, and might be the best way of keeping the build quiet.
