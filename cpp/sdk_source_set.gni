import("//build/cpp/sdk_library.gni")

# A source set that can be exported to an SDK.
#
# An equivalent to the built-in source_set which adds an SDK atom declaration to
# allow the set to be included in an SDK as sources.
#
# Parameters
#
#   sdk_name (optional)
#     Name of the library in the SDK.
#     If not specified, a name is inferred from the target's label.
#
#   source_dir (optional)
#     If set, path to the base directory of the sources.
#     This is useful if the sources are generated and therefore not hosted
#     directly under the directory where the GN rules are declared.
