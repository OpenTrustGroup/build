import("//build/rust/rustc_artifact.gni")

# Defines a Rust library
#
# Parameters
#
#   name
#     Name of the crate as defined in its manifest file. If not specified, it is
#     assumed to be the same as the target name.
#
#   version
#     Semver version of the crate as seen on crates.io.
#
#   edition
#     Edition of the Rust language to be used.
#     Options are "2015" and "2018". If unsure, choose "2018".
#
#   deps (optional)
#     List of rust_library GN targets on which this crate depends.
#     Third party crates can be included through paths like
#     "//third_party/rust-crates/rustc_deps:<cratename>",
#
#   non_rust_deps (optional)
#     List of non-rust_library GN targets on which this crate depends.
#
#   with_unit_tests (optional)
#     Builds unit tests associated with the binary. This will create a
#     `<name>-bin-unit-test` test file in the output directory.
#
#   source_root (optional)
#     Location of the crate root (e.g. `src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs`).
#     This defaults to `./src/main.rs` for binaries and `./src/lib.rs` for libraries,
#     and should only be changed when absolutely necessary
#     (such as in the case of generated code).
#
#   output_name (optional)
#     Name of the output file.
#
# Example of usage:
#
#   rustc_library("foo") {
#     deps = [
#       "//garnet/public/rust/crates/bar",
#       "//third_party/rust-crates/rustc_deps:clap",
#       "//third_party/rust-crates/rustc_deps:serde",
#       "//third_party/rust-crates/rustc_deps:slab",
#     ]
#     with_unit_tests = true
#   }
